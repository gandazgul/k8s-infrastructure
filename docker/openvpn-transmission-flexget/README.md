# Transmission and Flexget running over OpenVPN

**Heavily modified from https://github.com/haugene/docker-transmission-openvpn, most of the credit goes there. I simply added flexget and stripped down the container for my needs**

This container contains OpenVPN, Flexget and Transmission with a configuration
where Transmission and Flexget are running only when OpenVPN has an active tunnel.
It expects the OpenVPN and flexget config files to be mounted on /config.

You need to specify the transmission config with environment variables,
as well as mounting volumes where the data should be stored.
An example run command to get you going is provided below.

-- look into maintaining this funcionality:
Also worth mentioning.
If you want to route web traffic through the same tunnel that Transmission is using there
is a pre-installed Tinyproxy which will expose a proxy on port 8888 when enabled.

If you run into problems, please check the README twice before opening an issue :)

### about:maintenance

This image was created for my own use, but sharing is caring so it had to be open source.

You can help out by submitting pull-requests or helping others with
open issues.

## Run container from Docker registry
The container is available from the Docker registry and this is the simplest way to get it.
To run the container use this command:

```
$ docker run --cap-add=NET_ADMIN --device=/dev/net/tun -d \
              -v /your/storage/path/:/data \
              -v /etc/localtime:/etc/localtime:ro \
              -v /your/config/:/config
              -e WEBPROXY_ENABLED=false \
              -e LOCAL_NETWORK=192.168.0.0/16 \
              --log-driver json-file \
              --log-opt max-size=10m \
              -p 9091:9091 \
              gandazgul/openvpn-transmission-flexget
```

As you can see, the container also expects a data volume to be mounted.
This is where Transmission will store your downloads, incomplete downloads and look for a watch directory for new .torrent files.
By default a folder named transmission-home will also be created under /data, this is where Transmission stores its state.

### Network configuration options
| Variable | Function | Example |
|----------|----------|-------|
|`OPENVPN_OPTS` | Will be passed to OpenVPN on startup | See [OpenVPN doc](https://openvpn.net/index.php/open-source/documentation/manuals/65-openvpn-20x-manpage.html) |
|`LOCAL_NETWORK` | Sets the local network that should have access. Accepts comma separated list. | `LOCAL_NETWORK=192.168.0.0/24`|

### Firewall configuration options
When enabled, the firewall blocks everything except traffic to the peer port and traffic to the rpc port from the LOCAL_NETWORK and the internal docker gateway.

If TRANSMISSION_PEER_PORT_RANDOM_ON_START is enabled then it allows traffic to the range of peer ports defined by TRANSMISSION_PEER_PORT_RANDOM_HIGH and TRANSMISSION_PEER_PORT_RANDOM_LOW.

| Variable | Function | Example |
|----------|----------|-------|
|`ENABLE_UFW` | Enables the firewall | `ENABLE_UFW=true`|
|`UFW_ALLOW_GW_NET` | Allows the gateway network through the firewall. Off defaults to only allowing the gateway. | `UFW_ALLOW_GW_NET=true`|
|`UFW_EXTRA_PORTS` | Allows the comma separated list of ports through the firewall. Respects UFW_ALLOW_GW_NET. | `UFW_EXTRA_PORTS=9910,23561,443`|
|`UFW_DISABLE_IPTABLES_REJECT` | Prevents the use of `REJECT` in the `iptables` rules, for hosts without the `ipt_REJECT` module (such as the Synology NAS). | `UFW_DISABLE_IPTABLES_REJECT=true`|

### Permission configuration options
By default the startup script applies a default set of permissions and ownership on the transmission download, watch and incomplete directories. The GLOBAL_APPLY_PERMISSIONS directive can be used to disable this functionality.

| Variable | Function | Example |
|----------|----------|-------|
|`GLOBAL_APPLY_PERMISSIONS` | Disable setting of default permissions | `GLOBAL_APPLY_PERMISSIONS=false`|

### Transmission configuration options

You may override Transmission options by setting the appropriate environment variable.

The environment variables are the same name as used in the transmission settings.json file
and follow the format given in these examples:

| Transmission variable name | Environment variable name |
|----------------------------|---------------------------|
| `speed-limit-up` | `TRANSMISSION_SPEED_LIMIT_UP` |
| `speed-limit-up-enabled` | `TRANSMISSION_SPEED_LIMIT_UP_ENABLED` |
| `ratio-limit` | `TRANSMISSION_RATIO_LIMIT` |
| `ratio-limit-enabled` | `TRANSMISSION_RATIO_LIMIT_ENABLED` |

As you can see the variables are prefixed with `TRANSMISSION_`, the variable is capitalized, and `-` is converted to `_`.

Transmission options changed in the WebUI or in settings.json will be overridden at startup and will not survive after a reboot of the container. You may want to use these variables in order to keep your preferences.

PS: `TRANSMISSION_BIND_ADDRESS_IPV4` will be overridden to the IP assigned to your OpenVPN tunnel interface.
This is to prevent leaking the host IP.

### Web proxy configuration options

This container also contains a web-proxy server to allow you to tunnel your web-browser traffic through the same OpenVPN tunnel.
This is useful if you are using a private tracker that needs to see you login from the same IP address you are torrenting from.
The default listening port is 8888. Note that only ports above 1024 can be specified as all ports below 1024 are privileged 
and would otherwise require root permissions to run.

| Variable | Function | Example |
|----------|----------|-------|
|`WEBPROXY_ENABLED` | Enables the web proxy | `WEBPROXY_ENABLED=true`|
|`WEBPROXY_PORT` | Sets the listening port | `WEBPROXY_PORT=8888` |

### User configuration options

By default everything will run as the root user. However, it is possible to change who runs the transmission process.
You may set the following parameters to customize the user id that runs transmission.

| Variable | Function | Example |
|----------|----------|-------|
|`PUID` | Sets the user id who will run transmission | `PUID=1003`|
|`PGID` | Sets the group id for the transmission user | `PGID=1003` |

### Dropping default route from iptables (advanced)

Some VPNs do not override the default route, but rather set other routes with a lower metric.  
This might lead to the default route (your untunneled connection) to be used.

To drop the default route set the environment variable `DROP_DEFAULT_ROUTE` to `true`.

*Note*: This is not compatible with all VPNs. You can check your iptables routing with the `ip r` command in a running container.

### Custom pre/post scripts

If you ever need to run custom code before or after transmission is executed or stopped, you can use the custom scripts feature.
Custom scripts are located in the /scripts directory which is empty by default.
To enable this feature, you'll need to mount the /scripts directory.

Once /scripts is mounted you'll need to write your custom code in the following bash shell scripts:

| Script | Function |
|----------|----------|
|/scripts/transmission-pre-start.sh | This shell script will be executed before transmission start |
|/scripts/transmission-post-start.sh | This shell script will be executed after transmission start |
|/scripts/transmission-pre-stop.sh | This shell script will be executed before transmission stop |
|/scripts/transmission-post-stop.sh | This shell script will be executed after transmission stop |

Don't forget to include the #!/bin/bash shebang and to make the scripts executable using chmod a+x

## Access the WebUI
But what's going on? My http://my-host:9091 isn't responding?
This is because the VPN is active, and since docker is running in a different ip range than your client the response
to your request will be treated as "non-local" traffic and therefore be routed out through the VPN interface.

### How to fix this
The container supports the `LOCAL_NETWORK` environment variable. For instance if your local network uses the IP range 192.168.0.0/24 you would pass `-e LOCAL_NETWORK=192.168.0.0/24`.

## Access the RPC

You need to add a / to the end of the URL to be able to connect. Example: http://my-host:9091/transmission/rpc/

## Known issues, tips and tricks

#### Use Google DNS servers
Some have encountered problems with DNS resolving inside the docker container.
This causes trouble because OpenVPN will not be able to resolve the host to connect to.
If you have this problem use dockers --dns flag to override the resolv.conf of the container.
For example use googles dns servers by adding --dns 8.8.8.8 --dns 8.8.4.4 as parameters to the usual run command.

#### Restart container if connection is lost
If the VPN connection fails or the container for any other reason loses connectivity, you want it to recover from it. One way of doing this is to set environment variable `OPENVPN_OPTS=--inactive 3600 --ping 10 --ping-exit 60` and use the --restart=always flag when starting the container. This way OpenVPN will exit if ping fails over a period of time which will stop the container and then the Docker deamon will restart it.

#### Reach sleep or hybernation on your host if no torrents are active
By befault Transmission will always [scrape](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tracker_scrape) trackers, even if all torrents have completed their activities, or they have been paused manually. This will cause Transmission to be always active, therefore never allow your host server to be inactive and go to sleep/hybernation/whatever. If this is something you want, you can add the following variable when creating the container. It will turn off a hidden setting in Tranmsission which will stop the application to scrape trackers for paused torrents. Transmission will become inactive, and your host will reach the desidered state.
```
-e "TRANSMISSION_SCRAPE_PAUSED_TORRENTS_ENABLED=false"
```

#### Questions?
If you are having issues with this container please submit an issue on GitHub.
Please provide logs, docker version and other information that can simplify reproducing the issue.
Using the latest stable version of Docker is always recommended. Support for older version is on a best-effort basis.

## Controlling Transmission remotely
The container exposes /config as a volume. This is the directory where the supplied transmission and OpenVPN credentials will be stored.
If you have transmission authentication enabled and want scripts in another container to access and
control the transmission-daemon, this can be a handy way to access the credentials.
For example, another container may pause or restrict transmission speeds while the server is streaming video.
